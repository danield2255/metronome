I didn't like any of the metronome apps/websites I found, so I made my own.

I tend to use a metronome to practice music at a slow pace and gradually speed things up, so I included buttons to easily increment and decrement the tempo.

I also like to be able to subdivide at a quicker tempo than I could with most other metronomes (most seem to limit you to 240 BPM), so there is no upper limit on the tempo enforced by the code (your CPU will make it clear if you push it too hard).

KNOWN BUGS

1. If you open the metronome in a tab with a BPM > 60 and focus a different tab, the de-focused metronome tab only plays at most 60 BPM. This is a byproduct of using setInterval() I think and I'm not sure of the best way around it yet. To mitigate this I use the "small window popout" button which opens a new small window which retains the correct tempo when it's de-focused unlike a tab.
